abstract = {Laboratory testing of forages for nutrient content and digestion characteristics is an important management step in the process of formulating dairy rations. In recent years, there have been numerous changes in forage analysis by commercial testing laboratories. These changes are sometimes difficult to understand and minor philosophical differences still exist within different dairy regions across the United States. As a result modern forage test reports sometimes yield as many questions as answers. For example, many laboratories are now testing forages for NDF digestibility, but dairy producers or nutritionists may not be familiar with normal averages or ranges in NDF digestibility for forages grown in their area. For the most part, however, concentrations of key nutrients within forages such as protein, energy, fiber, calcium, etc. remain the basis for defining the quality of one forage over another. Additional forage tests, such as NDF digestibility, lignin, starch etc, that are now done routinely in commercial testing labs help to better define the quality of forages.},

abstract = {Reduced lignin alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars have the potential to increase the feeding value of alfalfa for livestock by improving forage fiber digestibility and to increase harvest management fl flexibility. The objectives were to compare the forage accumulation and nutritive value of reduced lignin and reference alfalfa cultivars when subject to diverse cutting treatments in the establishment and first production year. Research was established in 2015 at four locations in Minnesota. Reference alfalfa cultivars 54R02, DKA43–22RR, WL 355.RR, and the reduced lignin cultivar 54HVX41 were subject to cutting treatments with variable intervals between harvests. Cultivar by cutting treatment interactions were not significant (P > 0.05), but cultivar and cutting treatment effects were significant. Cultivars did not consistently differ in forage accumulation. Establishment year forage accumulation was greater when a fall harvest was taken, and first production year forage accumulation was generally greatest when alfalfa was harvested on a 40-d cutting schedule. Compared to reference alfalfa cultivars, 54HVX41 had an average of 8% less acid detergent lignin (ADL) and 10% greater neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD) but was similar in crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentrations. Cutting treatments with shorter harvest intervals increased forage CP and NDFD and decreased NDF and ADL concentrations. With a 5-d harvest delay, 54HVX41 harvested on a 35-d harvest interval had a 21% gain in forage mass and a 3% reduction in relative forage quality (RFQ) compared to reference cultivars harvested on a 30-d harvest interval, which could allow for increased management flexibility.},
